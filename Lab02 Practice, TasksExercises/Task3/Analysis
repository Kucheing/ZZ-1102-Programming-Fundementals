0. Problem:
* We need to calculate the area and perimeter of a blue diamond-shaped figure inside a rectangle, given its dimensions x and 𝑦

0. Given:

* x → base length of each triangle (in cm)

* y → height of each triangle (in cm)

* The blue diamond is made up of two identical isosceles triangles.

:Formulas:
1. Area of the diamond:
                    Area= 2 x X × y This is because there is two triangles so it'll be multiply by 2
since it’s two triangles: ![alt text](formula1.png)

2. Perimeter of the diamond:

Each side length: ![alt text](formula2.png)

Perimeter: Perimeter = 4 x side

3. Inputs:

x (cm) — base length
y (cm) — height

4. Outputs:

Area of the diamond (cm²)
Perimeter of the diamond (cm)
