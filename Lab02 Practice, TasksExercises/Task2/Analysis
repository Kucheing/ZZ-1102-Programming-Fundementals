1. Analysis
Problem: We need to calculate how much a certain amount of money will be worth in:

0. Two future years

0. One past year

Given:

0. Annual depreciation rate: 3% (meaning each year’s value is 97% of the previous year)

Formula:

* OtherAmount = CurrentAmount x 0.97 (OtherYear - CurrentYear)
 
* Positive exponent → future years

* Negative exponent → past years

Inputs:

currentAmount (BND)

currentYear (integer)

year1, year2 (future years)

yearPast (past year)

Outputs:

Equivalent amount in each target year
