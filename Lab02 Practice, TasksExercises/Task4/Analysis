0. Problem:
Given a certain amount of change (integer BND value), determine the smallest number of bills to return using only 50, 10, 5, and 1 BND bills.

0. Approach:

* Use integer division (/) to find the number of bills for the largest denomination.

* Use modulus (%) to find the remainder, then move to the next smaller denomination.

* Continue until all change is broken into bills.
