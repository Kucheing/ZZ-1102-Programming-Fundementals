Task6: Syntax Errors
public Errors {
❌ Missing class keyword. It should be public class Errors.

MAIN should be lowercase main — Java is case-sensitive.

string[] should be String[] — class names in Java are capitalized.

Extra semicolon after method header:
public static void main(String[] args); → remove the semicolon.

num3 is used but never declared — only num1 and num2 are declared.

Missing semicolon after num2 = 16.

system.outprintln should be System.out.println — System is capitalized.
