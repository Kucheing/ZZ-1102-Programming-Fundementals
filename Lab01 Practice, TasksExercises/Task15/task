*Task 15: Write a program that prints the balance of an account after the first, second, and third year. The
account has an initial balance of $1,000 and earns 5 percent interest per year. (Hint: Calculate first year
interest. The first year balance will be the sum of initial balance and first year interest. Then continue to
calculate second year balance using first year balance and so on.)

The balance after the first year is: 1050.0
The balance after the second year is: 1102.5
The balance after the third year is: 1157.625
