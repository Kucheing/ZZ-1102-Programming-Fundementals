Task12: Kinetic Energy
In physics, an object that is in motion is said to have kinetic energy. The following formula can be used to determine a moving object’s kinetic energy: KE = ½ mv2
The variables in the formula are as follows: KE is the kinetic energy, m is the object’s mass in kilograms, and v is the object’s velocity, in meters per second.
Write a method named kineticEnergy that accepts an object’s mass (in kilograms) and velocity (in meters per second) as arguments. The method should return the amount of
kinetic energy that the object has. Demonstrate the method by calling it in a program that asks the user to enter values for mass and velocity.
